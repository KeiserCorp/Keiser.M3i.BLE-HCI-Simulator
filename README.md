# Keiser.M3i.BLE-HCI-Simulator
**Simulates an M3i for development and testing purposes.**

Simulator uses a Linux Bash script which requires an HCI BLE device to operate.

If no HCI BLE device is available, we recommend connecting a USB adapter with Linux compatibility.

Recommended USB Adapter: [Plugable USB Adapter on Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ZIILLI)

*This script is very basic, and designed to be a building block for testing and development.  If you develop a more advanced script and would like to share it with other developers, please send a pull request and we will be happy to bring it into the repository*
