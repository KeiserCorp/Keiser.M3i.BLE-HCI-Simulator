# Keiser.M3i.BLE-HCI-Simulator
**Simulates an M3i for development and testing purposes.**

Simulator uses a Linux Bash script which requires an HCI BLE device to operate.

If no HCI BLE device is natively, we recommend connecting a USB adapter with Linux compatibility.

Recommended USB Adapter: [Plugable USB Adapter on Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ZIILLI)
